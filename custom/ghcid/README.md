Here's super basic emacs support for ghcid. This uses a terminal with compilation-mode.

This code also assumes that stack is installed, which maybe isn't a great assumption. I had to do that in the past to get ghcid to behave properly with my stack environment, but perhaps ghcid works well now with stack without having to invoke the stack command directly.
